# Implementation of an electronic circuit simulator program

We can have in the netlist:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Nodal Analysis: Comments (starting with *), resistors (R), independent current sources (I DC) and voltage controlled current sources (G).
- Sinusoidal Steady State: Comments (starting with *), resistors (R), independent current sources (I DC), voltage controlled current sources (G), sinusial current sources (I SIN), inductors (L), capacitors (C), transformers (K).
- Modified Nodal Analysis: Comments (starting with *), resistors (R), independent current sources (I DC), voltage controlled current sources (G), current controlled current sources (F), voltage controlled voltage sources (E), current controlled voltage sources (H), independent voltage sources (V).
